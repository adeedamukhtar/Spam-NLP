# Spam-NLP
# 📊 NLP Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering** on a text-based dataset using **Python**. The dataset consists of spam/ham messages, and the goal is to clean, visualize, and prepare the data for NLP modeling.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: `spam.csv`
- **Description**: A collection of labeled SMS messages categorized as **spam (1)** or **ham (0)**.

## 🔧 Steps Covered in This Project  
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Load dataset and inspect structure  
- Remove unnecessary columns  
- Clean text (lowercasing, removing special characters, stopwords, lemmatization)  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Word cloud visualization for spam vs. ham messages  
- N-gram frequency analysis  
- Sentiment distribution  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering  
- **Bag of Words (BoW) & TF-IDF** vectorization  
- Additional features (message length, special character count)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Pandas** - Data handling  
- **NLTK** - Text preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** - Feature engineering
